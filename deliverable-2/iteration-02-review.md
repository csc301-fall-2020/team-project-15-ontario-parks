## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. Decisions that turned out well

 * The reduction in the number of partner meeting
 
    * During our first-ever partner meeting, our partner and us decided to hold weekly meeting to discuss our progress. However, we found out the weekly meetings were not efficient after we met for three times. Since our partner do not have a technical background and we spent most of time developing our application, the first three meetings usually ended up with repeating the same things we discussed in the previous meetings. Therefore, we decided to reduce the number of partner meeting from weekly meeting to bi-weekly meeting. This transition allows us to reduce redundant and repeating information during our meetings and enables us to have more efficient communication and discussion bi-weekly.

 * Deadline/task Management
    
    In the beginning, we used Asana as our team management tool. We used Asana to remind us of our team meetings, partner meeting, and certain tasks. However, we quickly realize Asana was not ideal in our situation. Asana might be a good tool for managing team if we are in the industry and there are a lot "employees". However, it was tedious for us to signin to Asana and it was annoying that Asana constantly send reminder emails to us which crammed our school email. 
    
    We used WeChat as our main communication and task management tool instead. All team members use WeChat the most often as our daily communication tool. We have a group with all team members on WeChat, as well as a group for the three people who are responsible for frontend and a group for the three people who are responsible for backend. Using WeChat allows us to communicate with each other the first minute we encounter a problem or if we have a revelation or an idea. We consider using WeChat as a more successful mean of communication since it allows us to resolve problems more promptly and communicate more efficiently.

 * Division of tasks
 
    With a project of this scale, we have to break down our expectation of our product into manageble and doable components. We separate the tasks of our project   into two parts - frontend and backend. Calvin Yu, Yingke Wang, and Sherry Wang are responsible for completing the frontend of our application. Ka Chun Mo, Zhiyuan Sun, and Ting Shu Wang are responsible for completing the backend of our application.
    
    We consider this decision (the devision of tasks) as successful because everyone participates in an indispensible part during the whole development process. Overall, every team member completes their own tasks on time. Everyone takes part in a crucial portion of the application and everyone takes ownership of the features they are responsible for. 
    
    * Frontend: Calvin Yu is responsible for building the map page. Sherry is responsible for the detail page. Yingke is responsible for building the setting page and accessibility page. Tasks such as connecting with backend that are used by multiple pages are allocated in a case by case manner.
    
    * Backend: Ka Chun is responsible for setting up the code and folder structure of the backend application, connecting the backend application to the our database (MongoDB), and deploying the application via Heroku. Zhiyuan Sun is responsible for designing and implementing the API which is an important part for the communication of our frontend application. Shu Ting Wang is responsible for setting up the server for storing our audio and image files which is crucial since the whole idea of our application is based on the idea of building a Geo-**Audio** application.

#### Q2. Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

 * Organization of weekly meetings
 
    Our team has a weekly meeting to discuss our progress and what we plan for next week. We planned to meet every Saturday at 7:30 PM in the beginning. However, due to assignments from other courses and different schedules of our team members, we started postponed our meetings to a later and later date. The decision of postponing our fixed weekly meeting somehow planted the idea of meetings might be optional which results in not all member would attend the meetings and the postponing of more weekly meetings afterwards. In retrospective, we should be setting a fixed time for weekly meetings and hold the meeting no matter what individual situation comes up. We can debrief the meeting's content to the team members who did not participate in our team meeting. This can ensure us having a fixed meeting schedule instead of allowing a flexible change of the time of our weekly meeting every week.

 * Content of weekly meetings
 
    At first we decided to discuss whatever topic or problems that comes to our minds during the weekly meetings. However, it quickly resulted in a lack of direction and discussion during the weekly meetings. In some weeks, our meetings will be very efficient and effective in terms of planning and deciding what to do. In the other weeks, our meeetings did not have solid topics for discussion and quickly turned into chitchat sessions. To remedy this situation, we decided to have a plan before our meetings every week to lay out what we will be discussing during the meetings. This will make our meetings more time-efficient and less of a waste of time.
    
 * Time management
 
    As many of us are learning new technologies for this project, we allocated time for each of us to learn these technologies. However, we allocated too much time for learning the technologies and end up not having much time for the actural coding part of the project. Havnig better managed our shcedule and starting earlier would leave us in a better position in things like implementing CI/CD or following more strictly to our workflow.  

#### Q3. Planned changes

1. Making sure of everyone's time schedule in order to plan for effective task deadlines and meeting schedule

    Since everyone is taking different courses and everyone has different assignments, we are going to make sure everyone notifies the rest of the team members beforehand if they could not make the deadlines or the meetings. Then, the rest of the team can plan accordinly and make sure to let the busy team members know what will happen next after our meetings.

1. Having a fixed time for weekly meetings

    Constantly postponing weekly meetings was a problem as we discussed in Q2. We will set a fixed time to meet every week at 7:30 on Saturdays so that we will not change weekly meetings every week and every can set aside a time beforehand for our team meeting.


1. Having a more tangible plan of what to discuss during each meeting

    We will come up with a tangible plan of what to discuss during the meeting to avoid chitchatting/not knowing what to say/a waste of time as we discussed in Q2.

1. Asking all team members to contribute their ideas for the application

    During the weekly meetings, there were only two to three people who were the most active during the discussion. They guided the direction of our application and made major decisions in terms of what tasks we wanted to accomplish. However, the rest of the team members definitely have unique perspectives and useful suggestions that can improve our product. Therefore, we decided to increase our communication of ideas by having more one-on-one discussion privately and contribute those useful ideas during the discussions when we have our weekly meetings to implement and expose those important ideas.

## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
It has been a very tight schedule for us and our partner. We planned to demo the application to our partner this past Wednesday but we are not able to due to the conflict of schedule with an emergency on our partner's side. We have not been able to reschedule the demo this week because we are not able to find a timeslot that works for everyone in the team. We are now planning to perform the demo on Wednesday(November 25) and we will be able to update this part then.
